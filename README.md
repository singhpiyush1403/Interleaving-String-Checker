# Interleaving-String-Checker
This repository contains a Java implementation of a solution to determine if a string s3 is formed by interleaving two other strings s1 and s2. The solution utilizes dynamic programming to efficiently check the interleaving condition with a time complexity of O(n * m), where n and m are the lengths of s1 and s2, respectively.
